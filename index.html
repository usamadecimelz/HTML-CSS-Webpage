        <p class="p3">JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich. JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!If you are a beginner, we recommend starting with an online course or video tutorial. There are many great resources available online, and you can learn at your own pace. Once you have a basic understanding of JavaScript, you can start working on personal projects or attending coding bootcamps to further your skills.
